## About The Project

Palo Alto EV Charging Stations Usage And Other Related Factors
The EV Charging Stations industry is expanding as people increasingly adopt electric vehicles for various reasons. Palo Alto stands out as one of the few cities equipped with EV charging stations to cater to the growing number of EV drivers. These charging stations have a significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, saving gasoline, and contributing to other positive environmental aspects. Moreover, EV charging stations prove to be profitable for business owners.

Importantly, the availability of charging stations does not necessarily equate to high costs, as many stations offer free charging services. Leveraging the dataset, our goal is to construct a model capable of predicting the benefits of charging stations for the city of Palo Alto.

## EDA and Initial Models

Originally, there were 30 columns to begin with, but some, like 'Currency' and 'Country,' were dropped as they are not necessary for the project. Some new columns were added after the initial exploratory data analysis (EDA), such as 'byWeek,' 'weekend,' and 'weekday,' to analyze additional data on charging station usage in Palo Alto.


### Data
For now:
1 datasets covering all common charging behaviours are explored in this project:
* Public
	* Palo Alto (California, USA)



### Prerequisites

Here are the various R packages that can be directly installed in Rstudio as follows:

```
Jupyternotebook   -pip install notebook
